# scRNA-seq_Hepatoblastoma
Single cell RNAseq was used to further characterize the HB and PDX tumor compared to background liver to determine integral pathways and cell signatures in HB utilizing HB17 samples (the second passage of PDX HB17-F2 was used). After preprocessing and quality control (see Methods), we collected 26,886 cells across three samples.
